# Automated-File-Sorted-System
Developed an automated file sorting system in Python to organize files by extension within a specified directory. The script lists files, extracts extensions, creates necessary subfolders, and moves files accordingly. Utilizes os for directory operations and shutil for file movement, with comprehensive error handling.
